This is my app called 'Round the World! It's a simple app that allows users to track what countries they have been to as welll as countries that they are planning on going to.  This app is writen in HTML, Javascript, and CSS for styling.  In order to run the app, npm init -y and npm i express cors is needed.

There are three pages on the app. A home page, Your List, and a Countries page.  The Countries page has a list of countries that users can look through and either click "add" or "add to plan".  The "add" button will add that country to the "Countries that I have been to" list in the "Your List" page.  The "add to plan" button will send the chosen country to the "Countries I plan to go to" list in the "Your List" page.
